FB_Pop3EMailClient

Functional Description
The FB_Pop3EMailClient function block is the user-interface to interact with an external POP3 (email) server. It allows you to receive and delete emails. By using attachments of received emails you are able to get input for several system features which are based on files located on the system memory. Certain file extensions are not allowed to be stored on the controller file system via FB_Pop3EMailClient (refer to the ET_EmailStatus.InvalidAttachmentExtension parameter). This applies to files that are handled automatically by the controller and to system files, such as the controller firmware to help to prevent unintended overwriting.

Interface
Input,Data type,Description
i_xEnable,BOOL,Activation and initialization of the function block.
i_xExecute,BOOL,The function block receives or deletes an email upon rising edge of this input.
i_etCommand,ET_Command,The enumeration indicating the command to be executed.
i_pbyMailboxBuffer,POINTER TO BYTE, Start address of the first byte in which the incoming emails are stored.
i_udiBufferSize,UDINT,Size of the mailbox buffer.<
i_uiEMailsToReceive,UINT,Number of emails to receive from the server.
i_sFilePath,STRING[200],Path to the folder in the controller file system where the folder EMailAttachments is created. Inside this folder, the attachments of the received emails are stored. The file extension defined with the ET_EMailStatus.InvalidAttachmentExtension parameter cannot be stored. NOTE: If you receive a second attachment with identical name as an already available attachment in this folder, the older file may be overwritten if the global parameter ST_CredentialsReceiveEMail.i_xOverwriteAttachment is set to TRUE.
If this string is empty, the folder EMailAttachments is created at the default file path of the controller.
i_sUniqueID,STRING[70],The unique ID that is required to delete an email.After the email has been received from the server, the unique ID is displayed at the output q_astInbox.
