FB_SendEMail

Functional Description
The FB_SendEMail function block is the user-interface to interact with an external email server. It allows you to send emails.
After the function block has been enabled and is being executed, a TCP connection to the email server is established using the user credentials that have been submitted using iq_stCredentials. As soon as the connection has been established, email data is transferred to the server. When the data transfer is completed, the TCP connection to the email server is automatically closed by the function block.

Interface
