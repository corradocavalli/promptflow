    "EMailHandling Library Guide\n",
    "The EmailHandling library provides email client functions that allow your controller to send emails to one or several recipients with the possibility to customize the content. The protocol type used is SMTP as standard for email traffic. It is also possible to receive or delete emails from a server using the Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3).\n",
    "This library supports SMTP and POP3 via a secured connection using TLS.\n",
    "Whether a connection using TLS is supported depends on the controller where the FB_TcpClient2 is used. Refer to the specific manual of your controller to verify if TCP communication using TLS is supported.\n",
    "You can connect your controller to an email server to send emails that inform about your machine status or report on key performance indicators.\n",
    "Library title: EmailHandling\n",
    "Category: Communication\n",
    "Component: Internet Protocol Suite\n",
    "Default namespace: SE_Email\n",
    "For this library, qualified-access-only is set. This means, that the POUs, data structures, enumerations, and constants have to be accessed using the namespace of the library. The default namespace of the library is SE_EMail.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Considerations\n",
    "Consider the following limitations for email transfer:\n",
    " Only ASCII symbols are supported.\n",
    " Only IPv4 IP addresses are supported.\n",
    " The EmailHandling incorporates pointers on addresses.\n",
    " Receive acknowledgement is not supported.\n",
    " Sending or receiving files via email leads to loss of file attributes\n",
    " Archiving emails (sent and received items) has to be performed in the application program.\n",
    "Automatic storage of email traffic on the controller file system is not implemented because\n",
    "emails are mainly handled in the controller RAM (Random Access Memory).\n",

      "This program uses the `FB_SendEMail` function block from the `EmailHandling` library to send an email. The `Credentials` and `Email` structured text variables are used to store the necessary information for the email and the authentication. The `Result` enumeration variable is used to store the result of the email sending operation, and the `ErrorMessage` string variable is used to store the error message if the email sending operation fails. The `xEnable` and `xExecute` inputs of the `FB_SendEMail` function block are set to `TRUE` to enable and execute the function block, and the `tTimeout` input is set to `T#5S` to specify a timeout of 5 seconds. If the `FB_SendEMail` function block is done and the result is not `Success`, the error message is printed.\n"
