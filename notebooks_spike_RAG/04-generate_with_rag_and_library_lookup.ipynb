    "EMailHandling Library Guide\n",
    "The EmailHandling library provides email client functions that allow your controller to send emails to one or several recipients with the possibility to customize the content. The protocol type used is SMTP as standard for email traffic. It is also possible to receive or delete emails from a server using the Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3).\n",
    "This library supports SMTP and POP3 via a secured connection using TLS.\n",
    "Whether a connection using TLS is supported depends on the controller where the FB_TcpClient2 is used. Refer to the specific manual of your controller to verify if TCP communication using TLS is supported.\n",
    "You can connect your controller to an email server to send emails that inform about your machine status or report on key performance indicators.\n",

    "General Considerations\n",
    "Consider the following limitations for email transfer:\n",
    " Only ASCII symbols are supported.\n",
    " Only IPv4 IP addresses are supported.\n",
    " The EmailHandling incorporates pointers on addresses.\n",
    " Receive acknowledgement is not supported.\n",
    " Sending or receiving files via email leads to loss of file attributes\n",
    " Archiving emails (sent and received items) has to be performed in the application program.\n",
    "Automatic storage of email traffic on the controller file system is not implemented because\n",

    "Functional Description\n",
    "The FB_Pop3EMailClient function block is the user-interface to interact with an external POP3 (email) server. It allows you to receive and delete emails. By using attachments of received emails you are able to get input for several system features which are based on files located on the system memory. Certain file extensions are not allowed to be stored on the controller file system via FB_Pop3EMailClient (refer to the ET_EmailStatus.InvalidAttachmentExtension parameter). This applies to files that are handled automatically by the controller and to system files, such as the controller firmware to help to prevent unintended overwriting.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the function block has been enabled and is being executed, a TCP connection to the POP3 server is established using the user credentials that have been submitted using iq_stCredentials. As soon as the connection has been established, the command specified with i_etCommand is executed.\n",
    "When executing the function block, the pointers at i_pbyMessage and iq_stCredentilas.i_pbyWhiteListSender are stored internally for further use. In case an online change event is detected while the function block is executed (q_xBusy = TRUE), the internally used variables are updated with the present value of the pointers.\n",
    "NOTE: Do not reassign the i_pbyMessage and iq_stCredentilas.i_pbyWhiteListSender to a different memory area while the function block is executed.\n",
    "When the data transfer is completed, the TCP connection to the POP3 server is closed by the function block. Received emails are deleted from the POP3 server.\n",
    "The function block FB_Pop3EMailClient saves the information of received emails in the memory area addressed by the pointer i_pbyMailboxBuffer. The positions inside the buffer, which contain the respective information of the several emails, is indicated by the pointers inside the structure iq_astInbox. In case the function block FB_Pop3EMailClient is enabled and an online change event is detected, the function block recognizes a possible change of the pointer at i_pbyMailboxBuffer and so the pointers provided within the structure iq_astInbox are updated accordingly.\n",
    "NOTE: Process the information from the received emails before modifying the address of the pointer i_pbyMailboxBuffer for the next execution.\n",
    "You can manually delete emails by specifying the email with the unique ID at the input i_sUniqueId and executing the delete command with i_etCommand. By executing further commands, the inbox structure available at q_astInbox containing the references to the email data are reset.\n",
    "Received emails are held in volatile memory. The volatile memory is cleared when power is removed, and all held emails are therefore deleted.\n",
    "As long as the function block is executed, the output q_xBusy is set to TRUE. The output q_xDone is set to TRUE after the function block has been executed successfully.\n",
